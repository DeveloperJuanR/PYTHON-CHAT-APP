A simple real-time chat application built with Flask and Socket.IO that facilitates communication between users in a department. This app enables users to send messages, customize their usernames, and get notified when someone joins or leaves. This application was developed following burakorkmez's tutorial ( https://github.com/burakorkmez/python-chat ), and is intended to help with learning and exploring Flask, and Socket.io. 

### Features
